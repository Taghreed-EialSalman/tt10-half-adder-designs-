## How it works

A half adder is used for simple binary addition of two 1-bit numbers. It uses XOR for sum, AND for carry. It’s a building block for more complex adders (like full adders and ripple-carry adders). 

## How to test

You test it by running all possible inputs and checking if the outputs match the expected values. Refer to the truth table of half adder.
